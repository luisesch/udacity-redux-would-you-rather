# Would you rather?

My final project for the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity.
The web app allows users to:

- answer existing polls
- view the results of polls they have answered
- create new polls
- view the leaderboard displaying all users sorted by the number of questions they have asked and answered

# Installing and launching Would you rather

In order to launch the app you need to run the following commands in the project directory:

- `yarn install` to install all project dependencies
- `yarn start` to run the app in development mode
